<h1><center><b>MY LIFE'S STORY</b></center></h1>
<p><i>My name is Ian Apelis and I am doing my second year of studying at t
  he University of Papua New Guinea. I am taking Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science(MSCS) 
  as my Major course.One of the areas in the field that 
  I'm studying is Information Technology Concepts(ITC) and right
   now we are learning about creating web sites using HTML and CSS.
   Later on we will learn about javascript. </i></p>

      <p><i>Html stands for HyperText Markup Language and Css is the abbreviaton of Cascading Style Sheet.Basically, html provides the structure of the page,and CSS provides the (visual and aural) layout for a variety of devices and they are the basis of buillding Web pages and Web applications. </i></p>
      <p><i>
      <p>So to any aspiring web technology developers out there, I would encourage you to learn more about this area because "technology is best when it brings people together" and it is always evolving thus, making it more fun and excitiing on your journey  . </p>
